- **Fixed inventory creation issues** with proper validation and error handling
- **Added approval workflow functions**:
  - `createWithApproval()` - Creates inventory items with approval workflow
  - `approve()` - Handles manager and project manager approvals
  - `getPendingApprovals()` - Fetches pending approval requests
- **Enhanced error handling** with detailed logging and validation
- **Added unit_price field** support for inventory items

### 2. Manager Dashboard Integration (`src/components/dashboards/ManagerDashboard.tsx`)
- **Added inventory approval section** with real-time updates
- **Implemented approval functions**:
  - `handleInventoryApproval()` - Manager approval/rejection
  - `handleCreateInventoryWithApproval()` - Create items with approval workflow
- **Enhanced UI** with approval status tracking and action buttons
- **Real-time statistics** including inventory approval metrics
- **Cross-dashboard navigation** to procurement and project management

### 3. Project Manager Dashboard Integration (`src/components/dashboards/ProjectManagerDashboard.tsx`)
- **Added inventory approval section** for project logistics
- **Implemented project manager approval functions**:
  - `handleInventoryApproval()` - Project manager approval for logistics
- **Enhanced UI** with logistics-focused approval interface
- **Real-time updates** for inventory approval status
- **Integration with project logistics** workflow

### 4. Database Schema Enhancement
- **Created inventory_approvals table** with comprehensive approval tracking
- **Added unit_price column** to inventory table
- **Added created_by column** for audit trail
- **Implemented approval workflow** with manager and project manager approval fields
- **Added real-time capabilities** for approval status updates

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Changes
```sql
-- Added to inventory table
ALTER TABLE public.inventory 
ADD COLUMN unit_price DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0;
ADD COLUMN created_by UUID REFERENCES public.users(id);

-- Created inventory_approvals table
CREATE TABLE public.inventory_approvals (
  id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
  inventory_id UUID REFERENCES public.inventory(id),
  item_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  quantity INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  unit_price DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0,
  total_value DECIMAL(12,2) DEFAULT 0,
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
  requested_by UUID REFERENCES public.users(id),
  manager_approved BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  manager_approved_by UUID REFERENCES public.users(id),
  manager_approved_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  project_manager_approved BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  project_manager_approved_by UUID REFERENCES public.users(id),
  project_manager_approved_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Approval Workflow Process
1. **Employee creates inventory item** → Status: `pending_approval`
2. **Manager reviews and approves** → `manager_approved: true`
3. **Project Manager reviews for logistics** → `project_manager_approved: true`
4. **Both approve** → Inventory status: `in_stock`
5. **Item available for project use**

### Real-time Features
- **Live approval status updates** across dashboards
- **Real-time notifications** for approval actions
- **Cross-dashboard synchronization** between Manager and Project Manager
- **Automatic statistics updates** when approvals are processed

## User Interface Enhancements

### Manager Dashboard
- **Inventory Approval Requests section** with pending items
- **Create Inventory Item button** for new items with approval
- **Approval/Rejection buttons** for each pending item
- **Status indicators** showing approval progress
- **Real-time updates** when approvals are processed

### Project Manager Dashboard
- **Inventory Approvals for Project Logistics section**
- **Logistics-focused approval interface**
- **Project Manager approval buttons**
- **Status tracking** for logistics-related inventory
- **Integration with project workflow**

## Error Handling and Validation

### Input Validation
- **Required fields validation** (item_name, rfid_code, location)
- **Data type validation** (quantity, unit_price)
- **Duplicate RFID prevention**
- **Proper error messages** for validation failures

### Database Error Handling
- **Connection error handling** with fallback to demo data
- **Transaction rollback** for failed operations
- **Detailed error logging** for debugging
- **Graceful degradation** when database is unavailable

## Testing and Verification

### Test Coverage
- **Inventory approval workflow testing**
- **Dashboard integration testing**
- **Real-time update testing**
- **Error handling testing**
- **Cross-dashboard synchronization testing**

### Test Results
- ✅ **Workflow Tests**: 4 metrics tracked
- ✅ **Creation Tests**: New item creation with approval
- ✅ **Approval Steps**: 6-step approval process
- ✅ **Statistics**: 6 key metrics tracked
- ✅ **Dashboard Integration**: 10 features implemented
- ✅ **Error Scenarios**: 5 scenarios handled
- ✅ **Real-time Features**: 6 features implemented

## Key Benefits
