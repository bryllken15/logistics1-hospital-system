# SWS Inventory Approval System Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of a comprehensive inventory approval workflow system for the Smart Workflow System (SWS). The system allows employees to request inventory changes, which then flow through a multi-level approval process involving managers, project managers, and administrators.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- **inventory_approvals**: Tracks new inventory item requests
- **inventory_change_requests**: Tracks quantity/status change requests
- **admin_pending_requests**: Queue for admin approval
- **approval_notifications**: System notifications for approval workflows

### 2. Employee Dashboard Enhancements
- **Inventory Editing**: Employees can edit inventory quantity and status
- **Approval Logic**: Changes > 10 units or status changes require approval
- **Request System**: Employees can create new inventory requests
- **Request Tracking**: View status of submitted requests
- **Real-time Updates**: Live notifications for approval status

### 3. Manager Dashboard Enhancements
- **Inventory Change Requests**: Approve/reject employee change requests
- **Inventory Approvals**: Approve new inventory items
- **Multi-level Approval**: Manager → Project Manager → Admin workflow
- **Bulk Actions**: Approve/reject multiple requests at once
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live updates of approval status

### 4. Project Manager Dashboard Enhancements
- **Logistics Integration**: Approve inventory for project logistics
- **Project-specific Approvals**: Track inventory needs per project
- **Cross-functional Coordination**: Work with managers on approvals

### 5. Admin Dashboard (New)
- **Final Approval Authority**: Approve requests after manager/PM approval
- **User Authorization**: Authorize new system users
- **System Management**: Bulk operations and system maintenance
- **Audit Trail**: Complete approval history tracking

## Approval Workflow

### For New Inventory Items:
1. **Employee** creates inventory request
2. **Manager** reviews and approves/rejects
3. **Project Manager** reviews for logistics compatibility
4. **Admin** provides final approval
5. **System** automatically adds item to inventory

### For Inventory Changes:
1. **Employee** requests quantity/status change
2. **Manager** approves/rejects change
3. **Project Manager** reviews for project impact
4. **Admin** provides final approval
5. **System** automatically updates inventory

## Technical Implementation

### Database Tables Created:
```sql
- inventory_approvals (new item requests)

```

### Key Functions:
- **Automatic Triggers**: Create admin pending requests when both manager and PM approve
- **Real-time Notifications**: Notify relevant users of approval status changes
- **Row Level Security**: Secure access based on user roles
- **Audit Logging**: Complete trail of all approval actions

### Dashboard Components:
- **EmployeeDashboard**: Enhanced with request system
- **ManagerDashboard**: Enhanced with approval interfaces
- **ProjectManagerDashboard**: Enhanced with logistics approval
- **AdminDashboard**: New component for final approvals

- Managers can view all requests in their scope
- Admins have full system access
- Secure data access based on roles

### Audit Trail:
