# üîç Frontend Debug Guide

## The Issue
Your inventory approval requests are not appearing in the manager dashboard, even though the backend is working correctly.

## What I Found
‚úÖ **Backend is working perfectly** - approval requests are being created correctly
‚úÖ **Database is working** - `inventory_approvals` table is functional
‚úÖ **Manager query works** - can fetch pending requests
‚ùå **Frontend issue** - something is preventing the requests from being created through the UI

## How to Debug

### 1. Check Browser Console
1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Login as Employee
3. Open Developer Tools (F12)
4. Go to **Console** tab
5. Try to create a new inventory request
6. Look for any **red error messages**

### 2. Check Network Tab
1. In Developer Tools, go to **Network** tab
2. Try to create a new inventory request
3. Look for any failed requests (red entries)
4. Check if the request is being sent to the database

### 3. Test the Frontend Function
1. In the browser console, try this code:
```javascript
// Test if the inventory service is working
console.log('Testing inventory service...');

// Check if the function exists
if (typeof inventoryService !== 'undefined') {
  console.log('inventoryService exists');
  console.log('createWithApproval function:', typeof inventoryService.createWithApproval);
} else {
  console.log('inventoryService not found');
}
```

### 4. Manual Test
Try creating a request and check if it appears in the database:
1. Create a request through the frontend
2. Run this in the terminal:
```bash
node debug-approval-requests.js
```

## Possible Issues

### Issue 1: JavaScript Error
The frontend might have a JavaScript error preventing the request from being sent.

**Solution**: Check browser console for errors.

### Issue 2: User ID Mismatch
The frontend might be using a different user ID than expected.

**Solution**: Check if the user ID in the frontend matches the one in the database.

### Issue 3: Function Not Called
The frontend might not be calling the `createWithApproval` function.

**Solution**: Add console.log statements to the frontend code to debug.

### Issue 4: Network Error
The request might be failing due to network issues.

**Solution**: Check the Network tab in Developer Tools.

## Quick Fix

If you want to test immediately, you can create a request manually:

1. **Login as Employee** in the frontend
2. **Open Developer Tools** (F12)
3. **Go to Console tab**
4. **Paste this code**:

```javascript
// Create a test approval request
const testRequest = {
  item_name: 'Manual Test Item',
  quantity: 25,
  unit_price: 15.50,
  location: 'Test Location',
  reason: 'Manual test request',
  requested_by: 'dbbd608b-377f-4368-b61e-102f1f727f4f',
  request_type: 'new_item'
};

// Call the service function
inventoryService.createWithApproval(testRequest, 'dbbd608b-377f-4368-b61e-102f1f727f4f')
  .then(result => {
    console.log('‚úÖ Request created successfully:', result);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('‚ùå Error creating request:', error);
  });
```

5. **Press Enter** to run the code
6. **Check if the request appears** in the manager dashboard

## Expected Result

After running the manual test:
1. You should see a success message in the console
2. The request should appear in the manager dashboard
3. The request should appear in the employee dashboard

## Next Steps

Once you identify the issue:
1. **If it's a JavaScript error**: Fix the error in the frontend code
2. **If it's a network error**: Check your internet connection and Supabase settings
3. **If it's a user ID issue**: Update the frontend to use the correct user ID
4. **If it's a function issue**: Check if the `createWithApproval` function is being called correctly

Let me know what you find in the browser console!
