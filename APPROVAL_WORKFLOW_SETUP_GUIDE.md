# Approval Workflow Integration - Complete Setup Guide

## 🎉 Integration Complete!

Your approval workflow system has been successfully integrated with the following features:

### ✅ What's Been Implemented

1. **Database Schema** - Complete approval tables with multi-level workflow
2. **Employee Dashboard** - Can create both purchase requests and inventory requests
3. **Manager Dashboard** - Can approve/reject all types of requests
4. **Project Manager Dashboard** - Final approval for all requests
5. **Real-time Notifications** - Instant updates across all dashboards
6. **Multi-level Approval Logic** - Employee → Manager → Project Manager

### 🔧 Setup Instructions

#### 1. Configure Supabase Credentials

Create a `.env` file in your project root with your Supabase credentials:

```env
# Your Supabase Project URL
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co

# Your Supabase Anon Key  
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

**How to get these values:**
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Click on "Settings" → "API"
3. Copy the "Project URL" (this is your VITE_SUPABASE_URL)
4. Copy the "anon public" key (this is your VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)

#### 2. Run Database Migration

Execute the database migration script to create all required tables:

```bash
# Run the migration script in your Supabase SQL editor
# Copy and paste the contents of: approval-workflow-migration.sql
```

#### 3. Test the Integration

Run the comprehensive test script to verify everything works:

```bash
node test-complete-approval-workflows.js
```

## 🚀 How the Approval Workflows Work

2. **Manager** reviews and approves/rejects
3. **Project Manager** gives final approval
4. **System** creates purchase request when both approve

### Inventory Workflow  
1. **Employee** creates an inventory change request
2. **Manager** reviews and approves/rejects
3. **Project Manager** gives final approval
4. **System** creates inventory item when both approve
