## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### ManagerDashboard Enhancements
```typescript
// Enhanced stats with real-time data
const [stats, setStats] = useState({
  totalProcurementRequests: 0,
  totalWarehouseStock: 0,
  ongoingProjects: 0,
  assetsUnderMaintenance: 0,
  pendingApprovals: 0,
  totalSpending: 0,
  completedProjects: 0,
  criticalAssets: 0
})

// Real-time approval with procurement connection
const handleApproveWithProcurementConnection = async (requestId: string, requestType: 'order' | 'request') => {
  // Approves request and forwards to procurement dashboard
  // Logs approval with procurement connection
  // Updates real-time stats
}

// Project update with logistics connection
const handleUpdateProjectWithLogisticsConnection = async (projectId: string, newProgress: number) => {
  // Updates project progress and connects to logistics
  // Logs progress update with logistics connection
  // Synchronizes with project manager dashboard
}
```

### ProcurementDashboard Enhancements
```typescript
// Handle approved requests from ManagerDashboard
const handleApprovedRequestFromManager = async (requestId: string, requestType: 'order' | 'request') => {
  // Processes approved requests from manager
  // Updates procurement workflow
  // Logs procurement processing
}
```

### ProjectManagerDashboard Enhancements
```typescript
// Handle project updates from ManagerDashboard
const handleProjectUpdateFromManager = async (projectId: string, newProgress: number) => {
  // Processes project updates from manager
  // Updates logistics status
  // Synchronizes with project logistics
}

// Enhanced logistics tracking
const handleLogisticsStatusUpdate = async (projectId: string, logisticsStatus: string) => {
  // Updates project logistics status
  // Logs logistics changes
  // Maintains real-time synchronization
}
```
