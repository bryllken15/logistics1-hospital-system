# Complete Setup Guide - Hospital Logistics System

## Current Status

You're seeing "Invalid username or password" errors because the database hasn't been set up yet in your Supabase instance. This is expected and normal!

## üéØ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Run Database Setup in Supabase

**This is the MOST IMPORTANT step - it creates all tables and sample users**

1. **Go to your Supabase project dashboard**
   - Open [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Sign in and select your project

2. **Open SQL Editor**
   - Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar

3. **Run the base migration script**
   - Copy the entire content from `supabase/clean_migration.sql`
   - Paste it into the SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" button
   - Wait for it to complete (should take 5-10 seconds)

4. **Run the approval system script**
   - Copy the entire content from `CREATE_APPROVAL_SYSTEM.sql`
   - Paste it into the SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" button
   - Wait for it to complete

### Step 2: Verify Database Setup

After running both scripts, you should have:

**‚úÖ All Tables Created:**
- users (with 7 sample users)
- notifications
- purchase_requests (enhanced schema)
- purchase_request_approvals
- inventory_change_approvals
- approval_workflows
- And all other system tables

**‚úÖ Sample Users Created:**
| Username | Password | Role | Authorized |
|----------|----------|------|------------|
| admin | admin123 | admin | ‚úÖ |
| manager | manager123 | manager | ‚úÖ |
| employee | employee123 | employee | ‚úÖ |
| procurement | procurement123 | procurement | ‚úÖ |
| project_manager | pm123 | project_manager | ‚úÖ |
| maintenance | maintenance123 | maintenance | ‚úÖ |
| document_analyst | analyst123 | document_analyst | ‚úÖ |

### Step 3: Test Your Application

1. **Start your frontend application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open your browser:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:5173` (or your configured port)

3. **Try logging in:**
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123`

4. **Expected Result:**
   - ‚úÖ Login successful
   - ‚úÖ Admin dashboard loads
   - ‚úÖ No "notifications.filter is not a function" errors
   - ‚úÖ All dashboard features working

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Invalid username or password"

**Cause:** Database hasn't been set up yet

**Solution:**
1. Run `supabase/clean_migration.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
2. This creates the users table and sample users
3. Try logging in again

### Issue: "Column does not exist" errors

**Cause:** Schema mismatch or incomplete migration

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you ran the UPDATED `supabase/clean_migration.sql`
2. The file should include enhanced purchase_requests schema
3. Re-run the migration if needed

### Issue: "Foreign key constraint violation"

**Cause:** Trying to run CREATE_APPROVAL_SYSTEM.sql before clean_migration.sql

**Solution:**
1. Run scripts in correct order:
   - First: `supabase/clean_migration.sql`
   - Second: `CREATE_APPROVAL_SYSTEM.sql`

## üìã What Each Script Does

### `supabase/clean_migration.sql`
- Creates all base tables
- Creates user roles and types
- Inserts 7 sample users with passwords
- Sets up Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Enables real-time subscriptions
- Inserts sample data for all modules

### `CREATE_APPROVAL_SYSTEM.sql`
- Creates approval workflow tables
- Creates RPC functions for approval workflows
- Sets up real-time triggers
- Inserts sample approval workflows
- Creates sample purchase requests

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

After completing setup, you should be able to:

1. **Login with any test user** ‚úÖ
2. **See role-specific dashboard** ‚úÖ
3. **No "notifications.filter is not a function" errors** ‚úÖ
4. **Create purchase requests (as employee)** ‚úÖ
5. **Approve/reject requests (as manager)** ‚úÖ
6. **See real-time notifications** ‚úÖ
7. **All 7 role-based dashboards working** ‚úÖ
