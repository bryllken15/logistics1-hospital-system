# 🔧 Inventory Schema Fix Guide

## 🚨 **URGENT: Inventory Table Missing Category Column**

The error `column "category" of relation "inventory" does not exist` indicates that your inventory table is missing the `category` column required for the sample data insertion.

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The `inventory` table was created without the `category` column, but the sample data insertion script expects this column to exist.

## 🚀 **Quick Fix Solutions**

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Recommended)
```sql
-- Go to Supabase → SQL Editor
-- Copy and paste the entire fix-inventory-schema.sql script
-- Click "Run" to execute
```

### Option 2: Complete Schema Fix
```sql
-- Go to Supabase → SQL Editor
-- Copy and paste the entire COMPLETE_SCHEMA_FIX.sql script
-- Click "Run" to execute
```

- RLS policies configured correctly
- No more schema mismatch errors

### ✅ Application Level
- Procurement dashboard can load inventory
- No more "column does not exist" errors
- Inventory management features work

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

### 1. Check Inventory Table
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to verify
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'inventory' 
AND table_schema = 'public';
```

**Expected Output:**
```
column_name     | data_type
----------------|----------
id              | uuid
item_name       | text
category        | text      ← This should exist now
current_stock   | integer
min_stock_level | integer
unit_price      | numeric
supplier        | text
created_at      | timestamp with time zone
updated_at      | timestamp with time zone
```

### 2. Check Sample Data
```sql
-- Run this to verify sample data was inserted
SELECT item_name, category, current_stock 
FROM public.inventory 
LIMIT 5;
```

**Expected Output:**
```
item_name        | category        | current_stock
-----------------|-----------------|--------------
Surgical Masks   | Medical Supplies| 500
Hand Sanitizer   | Medical Supplies| 200
Bandages         | Medical Supplies| 1000
Surgical Gloves  | Medical Supplies| 300
Thermometers     | Medical Equipment| 50
```
