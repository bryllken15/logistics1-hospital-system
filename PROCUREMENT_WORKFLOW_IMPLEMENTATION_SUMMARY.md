# Procurement Workflow Implementation Summary

## âœ… Completed Implementation

### 1. Manager Dashboard - Fixed Refresh Issue
- **File**: `src/components/dashboards/ManagerDashboard.tsx`
- **Issue**: Approved/rejected items weren't disappearing from dashboard
- **Fix**: Added `await loadManagerData()` after approval/rejection actions
- **Status**: âœ… Already implemented (line 566 in handleProcurementApproval function)

### 2. Project Manager Dashboard - Added Procurement Approval Section
- **File**: `src/components/dashboards/ProjectManagerDashboard.tsx`
- **Changes Made**:
  - âœ… Added `procurementApprovalService` import
  - âœ… Added `procurementApprovals` state variable
  - âœ… Updated `loadProjectData()` to fetch procurement approvals
  - âœ… Added `handleProcurementApproval()` function
  - âœ… Added complete UI section for procurement approvals

### 3. Multi-Level Approval Logic
- **File**: `src/services/database.ts` (procurementApprovalService.approve)
- **Logic**: 
  - âœ… Checks if both `manager_approved` AND `project_manager_approved` are true
  - âœ… Only then sets status to 'approved' and creates entry in `purchase_requests` table
  - âœ… Returns appropriate status for partial approvals

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Workflow

1. **Employee/Procurement User** creates procurement request
2. **Manager** sees request in Manager Dashboard and approves/rejects
3. **Project Manager** sees request in Project Manager Dashboard and approves/rejects
4. **Only when BOTH approve**: Request status becomes 'approved' and creates entry in `purchase_requests` table
5. **Approved/rejected items disappear** from both dashboards after action

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Manager Dashboard Changes
```typescript
// Already implemented - refresh after approval/rejection
await loadManagerData()
```

### Project Manager Dashboard Changes
```typescript
// Added procurement approval state
const [procurementApprovals, setProcurementApprovals] = useState<any[]>([])

// Updated loadProjectData to fetch procurement approvals
const procurementApprovalsData = await procurementApprovalService.getPendingApprovals()
setProcurementApprovals(procurementApprovalsData || [])

// Added handleProcurementApproval function
const handleProcurementApproval = async (approvalId: string, action: 'approve' | 'reject') => {
  // Implementation with proper role-based approval
}

// Added complete UI section for procurement approvals
// Shows approval status, manager approval status, and action buttons
```

### Multi-Level Approval Logic
```typescript
// In procurementApprovalService.approve()
if (approval?.manager_approved && approval?.project_manager_approved) {
  // Both approved - set status to 'approved' and create purchase request
  // Create entry in purchase_requests table
} else {
  // Partial approval - return status indicating what's still needed
}
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing Instructions

1. **Create Procurement Request**:
   - Login as procurement user
   - Create a new procurement request
   - Verify it appears in Manager Dashboard

2. **Manager Approval**:
   - Login as manager
   - See procurement request in Manager Dashboard
   - Approve the request
   - Verify it still shows but indicates manager approval

3. **Project Manager Approval**:
   - Login as project manager
   - See procurement request in Project Manager Dashboard
   - Approve the request
   - Verify it disappears from both dashboards
   - Check that purchase request was created

4. **Rejection Test**:
   - Create another procurement request
   - Have manager reject it
   - Verify it disappears from Manager Dashboard
   - Verify it doesn't appear in Project Manager Dashboard

## ðŸ“‹ Files Modified

1. `src/components/dashboards/ProjectManagerDashboard.tsx` - Added procurement approval section
2. `src/services/database.ts` - Already had multi-level approval logic
3. `src/components/dashboards/ManagerDashboard.tsx` - Already had refresh logic

## ðŸŽ‰ Expected Results

- âœ… Approved/rejected items disappear from Manager Dashboard
- âœ… Project Manager Dashboard shows procurement approval requests
- âœ… Multi-level approval requires BOTH manager and project manager
- âœ… Only fully approved requests create entries in purchase_requests table
- âœ… Complete procurement approval workflow functioning

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. Test the complete workflow in the frontend
2. Verify all approval states are working correctly
3. Confirm purchase request creation after full approval
4. Test rejection scenarios

The implementation is complete and ready for testing!
